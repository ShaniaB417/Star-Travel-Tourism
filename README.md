For the 2023 Nasa International Space Apps Challenge by SpaceTeam01 

ABOUT THE CHALLENGE

In the distant future, space tourism will likely be routine for Earth dwellers, but space travelers will need help choosing a destination and determining an itinerary. Imagine you are a travel agent at a future space tourism office. Your challenge is to create a tool that will not only develop customized itineraries for future travelers who want to visit the main bodies in our solar system—perhaps Mars, Jupiter, or Saturn—but also educate present-day users about the many different objects in our solar system.


High-Level Summary 
In our project we sought to answer the question, “what would space travel look like in the future?” We created an interactive website that showcases the main bodies of our solar system. We wanted the information we presented to be easily understood and shown in a visually appealing way, mimicking a tourism office. We tackled this challenge in three ways in our project. 
Provided information about space for the users of today 
Provided a form to plan a trip for the users of the future 
Provided an in-depth information guide for the users of the present and future! 


Project description 
For the Planetary Tourism Office, we were tasked with creating a tool that will develop customized itineraries for future travelers who want to visit the main bodies in our solar system. As a group, we discussed deciding that a website would be the best way to accomplish this task. 
The main technology we decided to use was HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We also used Bootstrap in order to create a seamless experience across desktop and mobile devices. 
We decided to break up our project into sections some of which include. 
Home: introduces the purpose of our site and provides users with an in depth information guide that can be downloaded to their personal device
Planets/Destinations: gives an explanation of the planets users can visit as well things to do and places to see on that planet 
Stations: On the websites we call them facilities, meaning that a user can stay there like a “hotel” 
Spacecrafts: On our website, Spacecrafts are modes of transportation. This is how our users will travel around space. This section also gives information about each spacecraft we mentioned on our site. 
Plan your trip: Lastly, we have the Plan your trip page, this is where our users will fill out the form and pick the destinations and times they will leave and arrive. On this form, they will also select the attractions they would like to see. 
Throughout the project, we took a lot of time to consider what future space travel will look like. Our goal was not only to create an educational site for anyone to learn from but also a fun site.
