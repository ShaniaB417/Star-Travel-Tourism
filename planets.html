                <p>
                    Visit Mercury, the first planet of the Solar System. It is filled
                    with interesting geological features that are rare compared with
                    other planets. Visit some geological parks and learn more about
                    Mercury.

                    The enormous Caloris Basin is the largest landmark on Mercury,
                    measuring 1550 kilometers across. The Mercurian landscape of the
                    Caloris Basin can be viewed from 2 kilometers tall concentric
                    mountains that surround this site, or from the center of the basin
                    to observe the large plains located there. An area of rugged and
                    anomalous land is situated on the exact opposite side of Mercury
                    from the Caloris Basin. It includes large, idyllic hills that were
                    formed from converging shock waves of the impact that created the
                    Caloris Basin. The exact processes and details that formed the
                    region are still debated amongst scientists. The Abedin Crater
                    puts on display a complex geological structure. A remarkably
                    expansive and flat plan surrounds the towering volcanic peaks.
                    Good views are overhead, from a satellite, in order for the
                    intricate geography of the region to be captured fully. Remains of
                    the MESSENGER spacecraft are also located on Mercury. The
                    MESSENGER spacecraft was sent to study Mercury and its geological
                    aspects. The acronym of it stands for ‚ÄúMercury Surface, Space
                    Environment, Geochemistry, and Ranging". Learn more about what it
                    was used for, how it got to Mercury, and how it functioned.

                <p>Visit Venus, the hottest planet of the Solar System.</p>

                <p>
                    It is a yellow, sulfurous world that is filled with unique and
                    mystical features unlike any other planet observed. Veils of
                    sulfuric acid clouds obscure the ground below, hiding its true
                    surface. Learn more about and understand Venus by visiting. Venus
                    was initially speculated to contain a very humid environment and
                    harbor life. Things to Do and Places to See Remains of Russia‚Äôs
                    Venera 13 Probe have been left on Venus. The spacecraft survived
                    for over 2 hours in the hostile and acidic environment that makes
                    up Venus. It took one of the only pictures of Venus‚Äô surface,
                    showing a gray-yellow ground and hazy sky. The Danilova Crater is
                    a relatively small crater on Venus.

                    spacecraft survived for over 2 hours in the hostile and acidic

                    Danilova Crater is a relatively small crater on Venus. However, it
                    features a large and near-symmetrical halo of debris/ejecta around
                    it. From radar imagery on satellites, it appears in a flowery
                    shape. Pancake domes are a geological phenomenon completely unique
                    to Venus. They are composed of circular plateaus that rise 1
                    kilometer above the surrounding landscape and can be dozens of
                    kilometers wide. Such instances of these have been observed across
                    Venus, notably near Alpha Regio and Eistla Regio.

              <h2> EARTH </h2>

              <p>  Visit Earth, the most habitable planet of the Solar System. It is a green and blue world that is filled with features unlike anything else in the universe, namely life. A bright ring of blue encircles the entire planet during the daytime, showing a nitrogen and oxygen rich atmosphere. Earth once contained uninhabitable conditions, but life prevailed, transforming the planet into what we know as the ‚ÄúBlue Marble‚Äù today.

                <p>   The Grand Canyon is a large canyon in which the Colorado River flows through. It measures almost 450 kilometers long and nearly 2 kilometers deep. It formed over the course of millions of years through the natural erosion process.
                Mauna Loa is the largest volcano on Earth, nearly 10 kilometers higher than the surrounding seafloor of the Pacific Ocean. It is part of a chain of volcanic activity that make up the islands of Hawaii.
                Afar is a region in Ethiopia where the processes of plate tectonics demonstrates itself in a visually striking way. The newest parts of Earth‚Äôs crust are generated through volcanic activity and lava flows. Geologic activity also demonstrates itself through the Dallol Hydrothermal Vent System, where geysers and hot springs erupt from below ground, erupting out acidic, mineral-rich waters. These minerals solidify, producing colorful terrain in the vicinity.
