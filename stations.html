        <h2>Facilities</h2>

        <h2>Mariner 10</h2>
        <p>
          Mariner 10 is a defunct space satellite launched in 1975 and serving
          Mercury and Venus that flies by Mercury every few months in its orbit
          around the Sun. Electricity and communication to Earth is available
          onboard through its solar panels and antenna.
        </p>

        <p>
          The solar panels and antenna, interestingly, were also designed to
          maintain a stable orbit around the Sun by using radiation pressure
          from the Sun‚Äôs light. BepiColombo is an operational spacecraft
          launched recently in 2018.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is the most modern spacecraft in our Mercury fleet. However, it
          makes large orbits around Mercury and Venus. The next Mercury approach
          will be during 2024-2025. On December 5, 2025, the Mercury Planetary
          and Magnetospheric Orbiters will be launched, signifying the start of
          its mission.
        </p>

        <h2>International Space Station</h2>

        <p>
          The most equipped and expansive space facility is the International
          Space Station. Situated in Low Earth Orbit (about 420 kilometers in
          altitude), it has very clear views of the surface below it. It is one
          of the few spacecraft that can support human life, and usually contain
          the only humans in space at any given moment.
        </p>
        <h2>Geosynchronous satellites</h2>
        <p>
          Geosynchronous satellites are also common around Earth. They rotate in
          sync with the Earth‚Äôs surface, making them useful for communications
          and weather monitoring. They always face the same area of the Earth,
          since it takes 24 hours for them to complete 1 orbit. They orbit at
          about 40 thousand kilometers above the surface.
        </p>

        <h2>The Hubble Telescope</h2>
        <p>
          The Hubble Telescope is the largest space telescope that can observe
          the visible, near infrared, and ultraviolet spectrums. It is very
          versatile, despite its initial problems. Initial problems involving
          the mirror shape were corrected through a lens that counteracted the
          effects of the mirror‚Äôs deformation. Additional image processing was
          used to resolve a clear image.
        </p>

        <h2>More Facilities coming soon!</h2>

        <p>
          Here at Star Travel Tourism we hope to add more Facilities, so you and
          your family can continue to enjoy the wonders of Space. So, Embark on
          the journey of a lifetime and experience the thrill of space like
          never before. Book your ticket to the stars today and make your dream
          of space travel a reality. The cosmos awaits your arrival! üå†ü™ê‚ú®
